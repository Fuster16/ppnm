
Since there isn't a lot to go after for this examination description, i'm giving myself some
assignments:


A. (6 points) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)



A.1 
Implement the PSO routine.

This i have done. The implementation can be found in the file "optimize.cs" under "PSO".




A.2
Debug your routine on certain functions: 
The Himmelblau's function: h(x,y)=(x^2+y-11)^2+(x+y^2-7)^2
The Rosenbrock's valley function: r(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2

Record the number of steps it takes for the algorithm to converge with damping parameter
w = 72. Also. Examine the convergence time as a function of the damping parameter, w.

The routine has been run several times for the above functions in regions of suspected 
minima, and yields:

{0}	and	{1}

{2}	and	{3}

And the Rosenbrock functions:

{4}	and	{5}

{6}	and	{7}

The relation between convergence time and damping parameter has been made on the Rosenbrock
due to it only having 1 minima. This can be found as "Conv_Damp_relation.svg".
However, this plot isn't very indicitive (partly due to my convergence criteria i think) and
in B i will thus try to record the average distance from the particles to the global best at
each step!




B. (3 points) 
Implement the "Bare Bones" PSO routine and compare the convergence time to the standard PSO
on the same functions as in A. Here it might be a good idea to implement generic lists in 
order to record the PSO routine.

The BBPSO routine has been run several times for the above functions in regions of suspected 
minima, and yields:

{8}	and	{9}

{10}	and	{11}

And the Rosenbrock functions:

{12}	and	{13}

{14}	and	{15}

In the figure "Conv_time_comparison.svg" the PSO and BBPSO can be found compared for the
Rosenbrock function. The figure represents the average distance the particles have to the 
(at the time) global best position. Another figure, "Conv_time_comparison100.svg", then 
makes comparison by averaging over 100 routine instances.




C. (1 point)
Here i have decided to modify the PSO such that the initial velocities and positions are 
quasi-random. Add the QuasiPSO to the Comparison figures from B.
The figures "Conv_time_comparison.svg" and "Conv_time_comparison100.svg" have been updated.

At a last moments notice i thought to animate the PSO, however this failed. 
I then tried to make some "Before.svg" and "After.svg" images of one of the routine instances. 
These can be found in the folder. However, nothing has changed? And i dont known why. I have
looked through my code hours on end and cannot find where it goes wrong. All of the above
results must be due to taking the best random sampling then.
