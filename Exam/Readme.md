All of my Homeworks (+ Exam) are structured such that the full description + results related to the homework can be found in the "Out.txt" file.
(Excluding figures ofc. Those are referenced throughout)

I have evaluated my Exam project to 5 points, in the hopes of a passing grade. There is a lot going on, and i had it somewhat working at one point. 
However, i have stubled into a programmers rabbit hole of problems and the final commit just doesn't want to work. Everything runs smoothly, however 
the final outputs i get are static, so i think it might be the optimizer methods. I hope there is enough material for you to evaluate that i just had 
a bad exam.
