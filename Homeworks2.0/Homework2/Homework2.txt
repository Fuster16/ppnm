A. (6 points) Jacobi diagonalization with cyclic sweeps



A.1 
Make a function "timesJ" which multiplies (in-place) the given matrix A with the Jacobi
matrix J(p,q,theta) from the right, timesJ : A --> AJ, in O(n) operations.

The function Jtimes lies in the "jacobi" class from the jacobi.cs file. 



A.2 
Make a function "Jtimes" which multiplies (in-place) the given matrix A with the jacobi 
matrix J(p,q,theta) from the left, Jtimes : A --> JA, in O(n) operations. 

I have taken some creative liberty and made "Jtimes" the function which multiplies the
matrix A with the transposed jacobi matrix J^T from the left, that is: Jtimes: A --> J^T A, 
since its structure can be made similar to that of timesJ (see jacobi.cs). 

The requested Jtimes function can thus be obtained by letting theta --> -theta.

Operation on a randomly generated (real and symmetric) matrix A, on randomly chosen matrix 
element with theta set so said element is should yield zero:

{0}
(p,q) = {1} (Randomly chosen elements)
theta = {2} (calculated such that A[p,q] = 0 after rotation)
timesJ(A, p, q, theta) and Jtimes(A, p, q, theta) are run and we get

{3}
with the corresponding random element zeroed (within reasonable error), i conclude the above 
implementation works.



A.3 
Make a function, say cyclic, that implements the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm for 
real symmetric matrices using the cyclic sweeps: eliminate the off-diagonal elements 
in a predefined sequence which spans all off-diagonal elements, for example row after 
row, repeating the sweeps until converged. The convergence criterion could be that none 
of the diagonal elements changed after a whole sweep.

The function cyclic lies in the "jacobi" class from the jacobi.cs file. The function makes
a sweep by applying the timesJ (followed by Jtimes) on each element above the diagonal, row
by row. The criteria of convergence is that the sum of the above-diagonal elements is below
a pre-determined number, "acc". This is done by storing the initial "sum of squared 
values" and subtracting (while sweeping, before zeroing) the given element squared from the 
sum and adding the (while sweeping, after zeroing) new element squared (which should now be 
zero) to the sum. 

It should be noted that the above implementation can be made ~2X faster by coding the cyclic
function elementwise instead of taking matrix products. The cycle function can be made to
only work the diagonal and above-diagonal elements (the matrix is symmetric at each step
anyway) and set the under-diagonal elements before returning.

Operation on a randomly generated (real and symmetric) matrix M:

{4}
(w,V) = cyclic(M) is run and found to produce the tuple items:

{5}
{6}

We check the properties of V and run several tests:

The calculation of V^T*M*V below should give a matrix D with elements D[i,i] = w[i]
{7}
Calculation of the reverse, V*D*V^T, should yield the matrix M back.
{8}
The calculation of V^T*V and V*V^T should both give the identity matrix
{9}
and
{10}
All of the above tests are seen to pass within reasonable error and i conclude that my
implementation of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm works.



B. (3 points) Hydrogen atom, s-wave radial Schrödinger equation on a grid

This problem concerns the radial equation of the hydrogen atom in the case of l=0.

The form of the problem is given by: 

			     -(1/2)f'' -(1/r)f = εf, 

which is comparable to eq. (4.56) from "Introduction to quantum mechanics" by 
David J. Griffith and Darrell F. Schroeter for l=0:

				u'' + (p_0/p)u = u	(4.56)

This can be seen equivalent if we let u(p) = f(p*p_0/2), yielding that ε = -Pow(1/p_0,2)*2
where p_0 = 2n ==> ε = -Pow(1/n,2)/2

The function u(p) has the relation u(r/a/n) = R(r)*r, where R(r) is a radial wave-function.
Thus the radial wave-functions in terms of f, is given by 

		R(r) = u(r/a/n)/r = f((r/a/n)*(2n)/2)/r = f(r/a)/r

for n = 1,2,3,4 and l=0, the corresponding expression for R_nl(r) is also given in 
"Introduction to quantum mechanics" in table 4.7 on page 151 and we thus have analytical 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors to compare.

A point to be made before computation is the analysis of boundry conditions on the given
differential equation. Letting r --> 0  ~~>  (1/2)f'' + (1/r)f = 0. For physical solutions
at r = 0, we thus require f to go to zero faster than r. (r-r^2 can be seen as the approximate
specific solution that goes through (0,0) with derivative (0,1) (physical conditions). It is 
thus unique and each physical solution for r --> 0 will behave as f(r --> 0 ) --> 0.)
Stringently the general solution for the differential equation (1/2)f'' + (1/r)f = 0 is

			f = A*Sqrt(2r)*J_1(2*Sqrt(2r)) + 2i*B*Sqrt(2r)*Y_1(2*Sqrt(2r))

Where J_1 is the Bessel function of the first kind with n=1 and Y_1 the Bessel function of
the second kind, also with n=1. Now. The Y_1 blows up at r=0, so the J_1 term is our physical
solution. The J_1 consists of a sum of power terms. By only including up to second order this
reads: J_1(x) ~~ x/2 - x^3/16 . The solution is thus of the form:

		f = A*Sqrt(2r)*J_1(2*Sqrt(2r)) ~~ A*Sqrt(2r)*(Sqrt(2r) - Sqrt(2r)^3/2)
		  = A*(2r - (2r)^2/2) = 2A*(r - r^2)

The derivative of the physical solution is still (0,1)

For r --> infinity ~~>  (1/2)f'' +εf = 0 which have the known general solution

			f = A*e^(+sqrt(2|ε|)r) + B*e^(-sqrt(2|ε|)r) since ε<0

The physical solution for this is f = e^(- sqrt(2|ε|)r) and we also find f(r --> infty ) --> 0.



B.1
Solve the grid representation of the above differential equation in f and obtain the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors using your jacobi routine. Investigate the convergence of
the lowest energy eigenvalue when you vary the number of cuts, dr, and when you vary the
lenght of solution interval, rmax.

The grid-representation of the differential equation is made and solved via the function 
"Rdiff" which lie in the "Hatom" class from Hatom.cs. The function takes (rmax, dr) as 
arguments and solves the grid representation accordingly using the jacobi.cycle function.

The initial rmax is chosen at 10 times Bohr radi. That is,
 
				R(10*a)*10*a = f(10)

and we get rmax = 10 and let dr be 0.1. (See Makefile)

The initial eigenvalues and eigenvectors are of size 100 and are thus sent to 
"Initial_Rdiff.txt" and not shown here. What is shown, is the first eigenvalue.

{11} This is very close to -0.5

Now. The values of rmax is varied with dr = 0.1 held constant and dr is varied with 
rmax = 10 held constant. (see B1.cs) The corresponding values of the 0'th eigenvalue 
as a function of rmax and dr has been plotted together in the "rmax_dr.svg" file.



B.2
Plot several lowest eigen-functions and compare with analytical results. 

The l=0, n = 1,2,3 analytical solutions R_nl from "Introduction to quantum mechanics" have
been plotted together with their corresponding normalized eigenfunctions in the 
"Eigenfuncs.svg". See Hatom.cs for the analytic solution expressions. See B2.cs for code.
