A.1 
Make sure that your QR-decomposition works for tall matrices. 


The QR-decomposition function has been shown to work in the "Homework1" assignment folder.
However, for completion this is also shown here:

Operation on a randomly generated real tall matrix (7,5) A with the "decomp" function, should
yield an Orthogonal matrix Q such that Q*Q^T = 1 and an upper triangular matrix R:

{0}

The decomp(A) function is run and we get
{1}
and
{2}

R is easily seen to be upper triangular and we find that Q*Q^T = 1: (within reasonable error)

{3}

Q and R must also satisfy the equality Q*R = A in order to be the uniqe decomposition and we
find

{4}

I conclude that the "decomp" implementation works as intended.



A.2 
Implement a routine that makes a least-squares fit—using your QR-decomposition routines—of 
a given data-set of the form (x_i, y_i, dy_i) from i = 1 to n, with a linear combination 
F_c(x) = Sum(c_k * f_k(x)) from k = 1 to m of some given functions f_k. The routine takes 
as arguments the data to fit (x_i, y_i, dy_i) and the set of functions (f_k), the linear 
combination of which should fit the data. The routines must calculate and return the vector 
of the best fit coefficients.


A routine that makes a least-squares fit—using the above QR-decomposition has been made and
can be found as the function "lsfit" in "OLSF.cs".



A.3 
The law of radioactive decay. In 1902 Rutherford and Soddy measured the radioactivity of 
the (then not well explored) element, called ThX at the time, and obtained the following 
results:

Time t (days)			  	: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15
Activity y of ThX (relative units)	: 117, 100, 88, 72, 53, 29.5, 25.2, 15.2, 11.1

From this data they correctly deduced that radioactive decay follows exponentil law 

				y(t) = a*e^(-lambda*t)

Now, assume that the uncertainty dy of the measurement was determined by the last-but-one 
digit of the measurement

dy (relative units)			 : 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2

and fit the data with exponential function in the usual logarithmic way,
				
				ln(y) = ln(a)-lambda*t

Plot the experimental data (with error-bars) and your best fit. From your fit find out the 
half-life time of ThX. ThX is known today as ^224Ra. Compare your results with the modern
value.


For this problem there are no requirements on how the main should handle the data (from-to
.txt file or from command line to .txt file), i have thus simply hard-coded it into the main.

The data is prepared according to the usual logarithmic way: 

			(x_i, z_i, dz_i) = (x_i ln(y_i), dy_i/y_i), 

with the functions f_0(x) = 1 and f_1(x) = x making the fitting function 

				f_c(x) = c_0 + c_1*x,

matching the hypothesis of an exponential decay law. The errors dz_i are calculated using
error propagation: dz_i ~= |(dz/dy)|*dy_i.

The function lsfit(fs, x, y, dy) is run and the c's are returned:

The data together with the least-squares solution are plotted together in "ls_sol.svg"
The halftime is now found using lambda = -c[1]:

{6}

This corresponds somewhat with the modern value of 3.6319 days. (wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium)



B. (3 points) Uncertainties of the fitting coefficients



B.1
Modify your lsfit function, such that it also calculates the covariance matrix and the
uncertainties of the fitting coefficients.

The c+dc and c-dc solutions have been plotted together with the c solution and data in
"ls_cov_sol.svg"



B.2
Calculate the uncertainty in the half-life value for ThX from the given data. This is simply
given as dT_(1/2) = |d T_(1/2)/d lambda|*dlambda = |ln(2)/lambda/lambda|*dlambda = 
|ln(2)/c[1]/c[1]|*Sqrt(S[1,1]), where S is the covariance matrix.

B.3
The modern half-life value is found to be below even the lower bound of the interval:
