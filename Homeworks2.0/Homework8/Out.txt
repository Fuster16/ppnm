Implement the Newton's method with simple backtracking linesearch algorithm where the 
derivatives in the Jacobian matrix are calculated numerically using finite differences as 
described in the Book.

The Newtons method have been implemented as "newton" in the "roots.cs" file according to the
requirements in the Homework8 description. 
I have taken some creative liberty here and implemented the refined becktracking linesearch 
as described in the book. The simple one can also be found in "roots.cs".

For the debugging i'm considering the two functions: grad(f1(x,y) = -(x + y)^2 + x*y) and a simple 
sine function: f2(x) = sin(x) if 0 < x < pi, f2(x) = 2 else.

Taking (0.1,0.1) to be the start value (guess) for first function and pi/1.5 for the 
second, the newtons method yields:

f1(r1) = 0.0185716212507076 and f2(r2) = 4.03447921253411E-06 with roots r1 = (0.10000014901292,0.0906918693572148) and r2 = 3.14360125624792

This corresponds with expectations and the right roots have been found.

A root for the gradient of the Rosenbrock function has been found by guessing (1.1,0.9).

The function yields f(r) = 4.87396211316796 with root at (0.979949097672044,0.965398125947079). 
This is an expected root other than (0,0) and thus also correspond with expectations.



B (3 points) Bound states of hydrogen atom with shooting method for boundry value problems

The theory for the problem of solving the s-wave radial schrÃ¶dinger equation is well known 
(and well explained if i must say so) from Homework2 and i thus refer to the Out.txt file
from this problem.

What is done differentlty here is that the differential equation

				-(1/2)f'' - (1/r)f = Ef

should be solved by a (my own) ODE solver with initial conditions matching those of physical
solutions for different values of E. Refering to the Homework2 explanation, the initial 
conditions was found to be f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 1 . Due to the (1/r) term however, this is 
not possible and the initial conditions are changed to: 
			
			f(r_min) = r_min - (r_min)^2 and f'(r_min) = 1 - 2*r_min

where r_min << 1. I start by taking r_min = 1.0/100.

The associated first order ODE is found by isolating f'' = Y(r,f,f') = -2(E + 1/r)*f to be:

		y = (f, f')	and	dy/dr = (f',f'') = (f', Y)

From the ODE library we can request function values F_E at some r_max, say 10 Bohr radii, 
without it tracking the whole function. The ODE driver actually provides function value
AND derivative. For the correct solution we expect both of these to be 0. The (0,0) is thus
our root and we can root find over the vectorized ODE.

This i have done for several values of E in the range (-1,0) for a visual overview. The 
solution values F_E(r_max = 10) as a function of E can be found in "ShootingE0.svg". 

By guessing -0.52, the root finder is able to find the root at -0.504730870990813, which is correct.
The resulting wave-function is plotted together with the analytic in "E_0Compare.svg".

The root-finder convergence as function of r_min and r_max separately, can be found in 
"r_minConvergence.svg" and "r_maxConvergence.svg" respectively.

The convergence of the root-finder with respect to the acc and eps ODE parameter can be 
found in "accConvergence.svg" and "apsConvergence.svg" respectively.
