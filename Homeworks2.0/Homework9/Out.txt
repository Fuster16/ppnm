Quasi-Newton method with numerical gradient, back-tracking linesearch, and rank-1 update.



A.1

Implement the quasi-Newton minimization method with numerical gradient, back-tracking 
linesearch, and a rank-1 update. Start with the unity inverse Hessian matrix and then apply 
the updates. If the update diverges or the linesearch fails reset the inverse Hessian 
matrix to unity and continue.

The Quasi-Newton method have been implementet and can be found in the "minimize.cs" file.
Due to failure and problems in the Homework8 programs, nothing fancy has been made in this
Homework. The only auxillary function in the "minimize.cs" is the "grad", a numerical 
gradient function.



A.2

Find a minimum of the Rosenbrock's valley function: f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2
Find a minimum of the Himmelblau's function: f(x,y)=(x^2+y-11)2+(x+y^2-7)^2
Record the number of steps it takes for the algorithm to reach the minimum.

This has been done. Two minima has been found for each function. 

For the Rosenbrock: R1 = 
(0.966393176048201)
(0.933987594945855)
(3)

and R2 = 
(0.995281091622769)
(0.990560357259476)
(27) (I thought there were a minimum at (0,0), but low and behold!)

For the Himmelblau: H1 = 
(2.99986726510412)
(2.0007599713589)
(4)

and H2 = 
(-3.7792832793059)
(-3.28321225692368)
(3)

The last indice of the solutions vectors above are the steps it take to reach minimum! 
(If you set "count = true" it simply extends (creates new vector of size + 1 and fills) the 
solution vector by one indice and adds the step count)

These are checked to indeed be minima by a separate cas tool (wolfram alpha)


B. (3 points) Higgs Discovery

Fit the given data-set to the Breit-Wigner function: F(E|m,Γ,A) = A/[(E - m)^2 + Γ^2/4]
This should be fitted by minimization of the deviation function. 

This i have done. The fit together with the data can be found at "HiggsFit.svg"

The fit parameters where found to be:

(m,Γ,A) = 
(125.972186152529)
(2.08633842388924)
(9.87624048733728)
