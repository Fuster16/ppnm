Excercise "math"

Objectives:

- Learn how to do simple math with C#
- Learn how to separately compile a function into a library and then link it to your Main function.

Tasks

1. Calculate (using System.Math class) (2)^0.5, 2^(1/5), e^pi and pi^e. Check that the 
results are correct.

The above requested calculations have been found using the built-in Math class:

{0}
{1}
{2}
{3}

The above values are checked by application of inverse operations, also from .Math:

{4}
{5}
{6}
{7}

2. Using the given stirling approximation for the gamma-function Γ(x), calculate Γ(1), Γ(2)
Γ(3) and Γ(10). Check that the results are correct.

The given stirling approximation have been implemented and the following results are obtained:

{8}
{9}
{10}
{11}

I find that these correspond well to theory by the formula Γ(n) = (n-1)!

3. The gamma-function overflows very easily, so the logarithm of the gamma function, lngamma,
is often a more useful function. Figure out how to modify the above formula to calculate 
lngamma. For simplicity you should only allow positive arguments for your lngamma.

This have been implemented as the method "lngamma" in the "sfuns.cs" file.

Calculation with the lngamma method yields:

{12}
{13}
{14}
{15}

By exponentiating with e we find the same results from Task 2:

{16}
{17}
{18}
{19}

The method thus works as intended.
