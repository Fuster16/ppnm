Exercise vec 
Build a class called vec to represent eucledian 3D vectors

This i have done. 
The documented code can be found in the vec.cs file associated with this exercise
Below is an extensive testing of the 3D-vec class:

u = 1, 2, 3
v = 2, 3, 4


v+u =3, 5, 7
v-u =1, 1, 1
2*v =4, 6, 8
-u = -1, -2, -3


u.dot(v) = 20
vec.dot(v,u) = 20
vec.dot(u,v) = 20


u.approx(v,1) = False
u.approx(v,1.1) = True
vec.approx(u,v,1) = False
vec.approx(v,u,1.1) = True
